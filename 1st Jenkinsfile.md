- A simple declarative pipeline in Jenkins is defined using a Jenkinsfile, which is typically stored in your version control system. Declarative pipelines use a more structured and simpler syntax compared to Scripted pipelines. Here's an example of a simple declarative pipeline:

```bash
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // This is where you can put your build commands
                sh 'echo "Building the project"'
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // This is where you can put your test commands
                sh 'echo "Running tests"'
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // This is where you can put your deployment commands
                sh 'echo "Deploying the application"'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- In this example:

- The pipeline block defines the start of your pipeline.
- The agent any directive specifies that the pipeline can run on any available agent (Jenkins node).
- The stages block contains multiple stages, each representing a step in your build and deployment process.
- Inside each stage, you can define the steps that need to be executed. These steps are typically shell commands, but you can use various plugins and tools to perform different tasks.
- This simple declarative pipeline has three stages: "Build," "Test," and "Deploy." Inside each stage, a sh step is used to run a shell command, which, in this case, is just echoing a message for demonstration purposes.

- You can customize this pipeline to match your specific build and deployment process by replacing the sh commands with actual build, test, and deployment steps for your project. Make sure to commit the Jenkinsfile to your version control system and configure Jenkins to use it in your pipeline job.
