- In Ansible, you use YAML files called playbooks to define the tasks and configurations for managing systems. Here's a simple example of an Ansible playbook, which can be considered a "manifest" for defining tasks to be executed on remote hosts.
- Let's create a playbook to ensure the NTP (Network Time Protocol) service is installed and running on remote hosts:

```bash
---
- name: Ensure NTP service is installed and running
  hosts: all  # You can specify the target hosts or groups here
  become: yes  # This allows the tasks to run with elevated privileges

  tasks:
    - name: Install NTP package
      package:
        name: ntp
        state: present
      tags:
        - ntp

    - name: Start NTP service
      service:
        name: ntp
        state: started
        enabled: yes
      tags:
        - ntp
```

- In this Ansible playbook:

- name is a description of the playbook or the specific task.
- hosts specifies the target hosts or groups where these tasks will be executed. You can replace "all" with the specific host or group you want to target.
- become: yes indicates that the tasks should run with elevated privileges (usually as the root user).
- tasks section contains the individual tasks to be executed on the target hosts.
- Each task has a name for human-readable description.
- The first task uses the package module to ensure that the NTP package is installed (state: present).
- The second task uses the service module to ensure that the NTP service is started and enabled.
  
- You can save this playbook in a file with a .yml extension (e.g., ntp.yml). To execute the playbook, use the ansible-playbook command:
```bash
ansible-playbook ntp.yml
```

- This is a simple example, and Ansible playbooks can become more complex as you define more tasks and variables to manage your infrastructure.
